Must:

- Make nis & kerberos5 work (done, but untested ...)

- Integrate chooser into kdm_greet
- Integrate kdmdesktop into kdm_greet
- Move clock from greeter dialog to desktop
- Add XDMCP _client_ to core (for remote login like in dtlogin)
- Add language selection
- Messages after switching to text mode

Should:

- kill warning on AIX - see bug #13628 (really present?)

- dpi/bpp/resolution selection. will require x-server restart.

Could:

- add a minimalistic window manager to the greeter (see gdm)
- make kdm kcontrol module invokable from greeter
- enable font AA support in greeter
- session name aliasing
- password change dialog for aged passwords
- starting kdm while a kdm is running in the background in "console mode"
  would reactivate the greeter. this would require lots of magic.

- Make remembering user's last session more portable (standard??)
- Animated logo
- Different logos for each session type
- User pictures in logo field
