Must:

- implement a "console mode" that is more adequate for linux

- handle _all_ config changes on the fly, including xdmcp

- export LC_* by default

- test whether nis, kerberos4 & kerberos5 work

- Move clock from greeter dialog to desktop
- Add XDMCP _client_ to core (for remote login like in dtlogin).
  Currently this is simply done by restarting the x-server with -query.
- Add language selection
- Messages after switching to text mode
- document config files

- bidirectional command sockets for better integration with kde session

- add bgset to XDM_MANAGED
  add FiFo command "background\t{inprogress,aborted,done}"

Should:

- check if pam works before trying to authenticate

- sync BSD_AUTH from xdm, sync osfc2 from kcheckpass

- kill warning on AIX - see bug #13628 (really present?)

- dpi/bpp/resolution selection. will require x-server restart - or use RandR.

- make config position independent

Could:

- pass FamilyBroadcast instead of hostname BROADCAST to chooser
- merge ipv6 xdmcp support from xdm

- add a minimalistic window manager to the greeter (see gdm)
- make kdm kcontrol module invokable from greeter
- starting kdm while a kdm is running in the background in "console mode"
  would reactivate the greeter. this would require lots of magic (suid root
  (disable -config option or make audit!) and make it write the fifo).

- Animated logo
- Different logos for each session type
- User pictures in logo field

- remote-accessible command sockets for remote shutdown, etc.
  or maybe implement it as an xdmcp extension?
- LoginMode=DirectQuery

- parse /etc/kderc?

ralf says:
- put the kmenu sidebar image on the left of the greeter
- enable the clock by default
- make PreselectUser=Previous & FocusPasswd=true the default
- alternate userview: make the "login" field a combobox
