Things to be done:

- Make more stuff configurable from kdmrc.
- Make the code less ugly.
  - Maybe use kresize?
- Animated logo?
- Different logos for each session type
- Make remembering user's last session more portable?

- Make nis & kerberos5 work
- Let verify return V_AUTHMSG for PAM and authenticate() errors -> messagebox

- Finish integration of the chooser for loopback remote login
- Possibly kill warning on AIX - see bug #13628
