Things to be done:

- Animated logo?
- Different logos for each session type
- Make remembering user's last session more portable?

- Integrate chooser in greeter
- Add XDMCP _client_ to core (for remote login like in dtlogin)

- Make nis & kerberos5 work

- Possibly kill warning on AIX - see bug #13628
