	* Conversation plugins can be configured now; option PluginConfig.
	* The "Restart X Server"/"Close Connection" action can be configured
	  away; option AllowClose.
	* The "Console Login" action can be configured away without touching
	  Xservers; option AllowConsole.

2003-10-27  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>
	* KDM now complies the input model of PAM. The greeter has an 
	  interface for conversation plugins, so alternative authentication
	  mechanisms can be handled; options PluginsLogin & PluginsShutdown.
	* Password-less and automatic logins now use a separate PAM service
	  (${KDM_PAM_SERVICE}-np).

2003-09-22  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>
	* Session types are now defined with .desktop files; consequently the
	  SessionTypes option is gone and we got SessionsDirs instead.
	* The previous session type choice is now saved in a different file
	  (~/.dmrc) in a different format (ini-file); the SessSaveFile option
	  is gone. Optionally KDM can be configured to store all .dmrc files
	  in a common directory (option DmrcDir); this can be useful for AFS
	  based installations.
	* The location of the administratively set user faces is now specified
	  by the FaceDir option and the pictures have a .face.icon extension
	  (or .face for "natural" images, possibly photos).

	The spec for the above changes is shared with GDM, so packagers should
	choose common directories.

	* The kdmsts file moved to /var/lib/kdm by default; option DataDir.
	* Nuked the AutoLoginSession option; i don't think it was useful at all
	  and it can be emulated anyway.

2002-12-01  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Integrated chooser into greeter; external 'chooser' executable
	  and the Chooser option are gone.
	* The chooser can be started locally (without an XDMCP query);
	  options LoginMode and ChooserHosts.
	* Added built-in xconsole to greeter; options ShowLog and LogSource.
	  This code is not built by default; uncomment the first three lines
	  in kfrontend/Makefile.am to enable it.
	* The DaemonMode option is gone. The command line switches -daemon and
	  -nodaemon still exist, but are mostly unnecessary, as KDM can decide
	  what to do based on the parent process ID.
	* The AutoLogin option and the -autolog/-noautolog switches are gone.
	* The AutoLogin1st option is gone.

2002-08-28  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Made it possible to specify the color scheme for the greeter;
	  option ColorScheme

2002-08-10  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Renamed kdmdesktop to krootimage and changed its command line
	* krootimage will be automatically invoked by the greeter by default;
	  option UseBackground
	* Chucked out the [Desktop0] section from kdmrc. Instead, the
	  location of the config file containing such a section is specified
	  with the BackgroundRc option.
	* User images can now be optionally fetched from the users's home
	  directories; option FaceSource
	* The default of the KeyFile option is now empty

2002-01-14  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Added NumLock option to preset the NumLock modifier state for
	  the greeter

2001-12-11  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Added AntiAliasing option to disable antialiasing in the greeter

2001-11-30  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Added GreeterScreen option to put the greeter on a particular
	  screen in multi-headed setups.

2001-11-22  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* The defaults of the options Xservers, Xsession, Setup, Startup, 
	  and Reset now back to more conservative XDM defaults, so it works
	  even without config files.
	* The default for the PidFile option is now empty like in XDM.
	* Changed option ShowUsers: "All" -> "NotHidden"
	* Renamed the option Users to SelectedUsers and NoUsers to HiddenUsers.
	* The GUIStyle option now groks all installed widget styles

2001-11-02  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Added conditional/scheduled shutdown modes; options
	  DefaultSdMode and AllowSdForceNow
	* Added command FiFo support (see README); options FifoDir,
	  FifoGroup, [ShutDown]/AllowFifo, and [ShutDown]/AllowFifoNow.

2001-10-04  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Changed default of AuthDir from /var/lib/kdm[/authdir/authfiles]
	  to /var/run/xauth.

2001-07-12  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Renamed the option Xwilling to Willing
	* The RandomFile option is not recognized on Linux and OpenBSD any
	  longer, as they have better entropy sources

2001-07-10  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Added the tool 'genkdmconf'. It's supposed to create a suitable
	  configuration for KDM during 'make install' by merging new defaults
	  with a previous XDM/KDM config (if any is found).

2001-07-03  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Added counterpart to the MinShowUID option: MaxShowUID

2001-06-16  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Optionally put the cursor right in the "Password" field when
	  a user is preselected in the "Login" field; option FocusPasswd

2001-06-15  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Replaced the ShutdownButton + ShutdownNeedsRoot option pair with
	  the tri-state AllowShutdown option

2001-06-10  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* The source directory structure changed entirely
	* External greeter: kdm_greet
	  - libKdmGreet.so is gone
	* External config parser is now named kdm_config
	* The config files are all located in ${kde_confdir}/kdm now;
	  KDM will no longer use kdm-config (most of its options are 
	  in kdmrc's [X-<display>-Core] sections now). Most options
	  from the [KDM] section of the old kdmrc are in the 
	  [X-<display>-Greeter] sections now.

2001-04-02  Simon Hausmann <simon@kde.org>

        * patch by Joachim Plack <jack@caldera.de> to make dead keys work
          when the keyboard is grabbed.

2001-03-19  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* External config parser: kdm_getcfg
	  - kdm will now use kdm-config, NOT xdm-config
	* Stolen idea for console mode handling from dtlogin
	* Tons of internal changes

2001-01-15  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Renamed LowUserID option to MinShowUID
	* The LogoArea option now accepts the value "None"

2001-01-13  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* The GUIStyle option now actually works and groks all of QT's
	  built-in widget styles and the "KDE" style

2001-01-11  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Added placing of the greeter at fixed coordinates; options
	  GreeterPosFixed, GreeterPosX, and GreeterPosY.

2000-12-09  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Added auto-login; options AutoLoginEnable, AutoLoginUser, and
	  AutoLogin1st
	* Added password-less login; option NoPassUsers
	* Added auto-re-login on XServer crash; option AutoReLogin
	* Added displaying the previously logged in user in the "Login"
	  field; option ShowPrevious

2000-12-07  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* New XDM port from xfree86 4.0.1
	* Made the greeter dynamically loadable
	* Moved chooser and greeter to separate directories, 
	  same for unused stuff (misc/)
	* A LOT of bug fixes and clean up

1999-11-09  Harald Hoyer <Harald.Hoyer@RedHat.de>

	* made kchooser

1999-07-02  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* Fixes from KDE_1_1_BRANCH:
        1) The "session type" wasn't updated when the user left the login line
        edit with Tab (Pressing return worked fine). This is fixed now.
        2) Kdm accepts NOBROADCAST in the Xaccess file now.
        3) PAM modules now have the ability to set environment variables
        for the user. Without this patch, changes to the env. are lost.

1999-06-07  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <hoelzer@kde.org>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp:

	  added Lilo reboot handling from 
          Stefan van den Oord <oord@cs.utwente.nl> 
	
	  added button to switch to console mode

	  TODO: Update kcmkdm to actually use these options


1999-02-01  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp :
	fork()/sleep() to prevent gpm and X from racing.

1998-12-17  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp :
	Changed char[] to QString. We want unicode ;)

1998-12-16 Duncan Haldane <f.d.m.haldane@cwix.com>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp : 
	(1) made the PAM service name configurable
	if KDE_PAM_SERVICE is defined (if not, it is "xdm"). (This
	should have been done when I did this to verify.c a while
	back).
	
	(2) Added a extra line to the shutdown dialog box
	"(Enter Root password") if it is in "RootOnly" mode.

	(3) Changed the confusing description of the "exit xdm" button
	to "Restart X server", which is the actual function of the
	third button.


1998-12-04  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* genauth.c (len;): Read random data from "randomFile" (usually
		/dev/mem) for auth key.

	* kgreeter.cpp (GreetUser): Removed hardcoded backspace

1998-11-27  Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>

	* Make the authentication cookie more unpredictable by adding
	times from X events to seed
