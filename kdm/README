This is the KDE Display Manager (kdm) for KDE-2.1, the KDE replacement for
the X Display Manager (xdm).

kdm is intended as a "drop-in" replacement of xdm. It reads the xdm
specific files (usually in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm), so it should not be
necessary to change them. You can change the configuration from
KDE Control Center. You will find the Login Manager module in "System"
-> "Login Manager".

In fact it's just a new greeter for the xdm, which was programmed in a way
that a replacement of the greeter module is possible.

How to setup kdm
----------------

After installation of kdebase, be sure to run kdmdesktop from the xdm
setup script -- on most systems located at /usr/X11/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0,
or somewhere similar.

kdebase's configure will look for your xdm configuration files and use
them. If the files aren't found, you can give the explicit path with the
--with-xdmdir option. If this is still not good, new xdm config files are
installed. These require hand editing before use. You might want to look
at the files in the "samples" directory. They show how to make Xsession
scripts for different window managers and setups.

Thanks to (in no particular order):

kdm is free software. I'm not sure exactly how it's license is, because it
has a lot of code from xdm in it. Anyway, i have to state:

Anyone is allowed to change kdm and redistribute the result as long as my
name is mentioned.  kdm is provided as is with no warranty of any kind,
including the warranty of design, merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.

Have fun with it (and feel free to comment),

Running KDM from init
---------------------

   Edit (as root) /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0

   Comment out everything in this file below (but not including!) the 
   first line, then append the following line:

       /opt/kde/bin/kdmdesktop

   Edit (as root) /etc/inittab.

   Look for the line: 

       x:5:respawn:/usr/X11/bin/xdm -nodaemon

   Replace it with:

       x:5:respawn:/opt/kde/bin/kdm -nodaemon

   This tells init(8) to respawn KDM, the KDE display manager, when
   the system is in run level 5. 

   To start KDM, either run (as root) /sbin/telinit 5 (to switch to
   run level 5), or (this is risky! don't do it until you _know_ you
   want the system to boot into this every time!) edit /etc/inittab
   and change the line:

       id:3:initdefault:

   to

       id:5:initdefault:

   If you do the latter step, then every time your system boots successfully
   it will go into run level 5 and run KDM, presenting you with the 
   exceedingly cute KDE login screen. 

   To edit the settings for KDM, as root edit the 
   file /opt/kde/share/config/kdmrc. This lets you twiddle with things
   like the welcome message, background wallpaper, and users to allow
   login via KDM.

Differences from xdm
--------------------

* a nice window with Qt-widgets to enter your login and password

KNOWN BUGS 

in kdm-0.[1-5]: 
  - the "BackSpace"-key had the wrong meaning on my XServer.
    So I hardcoded a   
           KeySym mysym = XK_BackSpace;
           XChangeKeyboardMapping(*dpy, 22, 1, &mysym, 1);
    Is this Ok? Is there a better solution?

Best regards and I hope you enjoy the hopefully nice-looking 
brand new graphically login to your workstation,
