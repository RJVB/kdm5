This is the KDE Display Manager (kdm) v0.92 for KDE 2.2, 
the KDE replacement for the X Display Manager (xdm).


How to setup kdm
----------------

KDM's config files are all located in ${kde_confdir}/kdm.
"make install" will install an example configuration if the directory
does not exist yet.

You can change the configuration from the KDE Control Center. 
You will find the Login Manager module in "System" -> "Login Manager".


Running KDM from init
---------------------

NOTE, that this description applies to RedHat and must be adapted for
other distributions/systems.

   Edit (as root) /etc/inittab.

   Look for the line: 

       x:5:respawn:/usr/X11/bin/xdm -nodaemon

   Replace it with:

       x:5:respawn:/opt/kde/bin/kdm -nodaemon

   This tells init(8) to respawn KDM, the KDE display manager, when
   the system is in run level 5. 

   To start KDM, either run (as root) /sbin/telinit 5 (to switch to
   run level 5), or (this is risky! don't do it until you _know_ you
   want the system to boot into this every time!) edit /etc/inittab
   and change the line:

       id:3:initdefault:

   to

       id:5:initdefault:

   If you do the latter step, then every time your system boots 
   successfully it will go into run level 5 and run KDM, 
   presenting you the exceedingly cute KDE login screen.

"It doesn't work!!"
-------------------

More input! ;-)

KDM accepts two command line options related logging. These options
_must_ come first on the command line, if they are used:

  -debug <n>, where <n> is a decimal or hexadecimal (prefix 0x) number.
  The meaning of the number is "explained" in backend/greet.h (the
  "#define DEBUG_<something>"'s). Just use 255.

  -logfile <file>, where <file> is the file to log various messages to.
  For internal reasons there is no option in kdmrc to permanently specify 
  another log file location. If you redirect KDM's standard error output
  to a file, KDM will log there.
  If KDM is configured to use syslog, all internally generated messages 
  are logged to the "daemon" facility. The log usually can be found in 
  /var/log/debug.log and /var/log/daemon.log; make sure, that daemon.* 
  is logged (look at /etc/syslog.conf). 

You should have gdb (GNU debugger) installed, so kdm can automatically 
create a backtrace ("crash log").

Send me the logs together with a detailed description what you did and
what happended. If your problem is related to a specific configuration,
you should also attach a tar ball (a tar.gz archive) of your kdm config
directory.
